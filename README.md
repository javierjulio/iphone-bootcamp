In June 2010 I attended the NYC iPhone Bootcamp taught by my good friend and former co-worker @mr-sk. It was a 3 day course where we learned to develop iPhone and iPad apps with no prior knowledge of the SDK or the Objective-C language. Each of the folders here are standalone projects completed throughout the course. The NotesTest project is something I did on my own to build a simple note manager app. Projects were built using Xcode 3. I haven't tried to run them with 4 yet.
