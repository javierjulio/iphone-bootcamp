Sending a message to an Object
What I know as Arguments, in Objective-C are known as Selectors
Arguments are something else, they make up the message

Init

- happens once immediately on creation
- however nib has not been loaded yet


ViewDidLoad()

- can be called multiple times!
- happens when view is presented


First Responder

- Is a proxy for the object that the user is currently interacting with.
- This can and often will change at runtime.


Delegation and Protocols

- delegation allows an object to enlist other objects to do its work
- by implementing methods defined in a protocol
- protocol method implementations are mostly optional!
- protocols solve the issue where you can't inherit from multiple delegates
- ex: have a view that needs to have a protocol for UITableView and UIAlert
- Option + Double Click to open the .h files


IBOutlet and IBAction

Outlet: pointers that reference an boject in the nib (IBOutlet)
Action: methods that can be triggered by object in the nib (IBAction)


Copying Projects

Find project folder in Finder, copy it and rename folder
Open in XCode and go to Project -> Rename
Careful with .plist file if deploying iPhone app!


Selectors

In Objective-C selectors have 2 meanings
It's the name of a method and unique identifier that replaces the method name
Basically a pointer to a method
Runtime system insures each identifier is unique
Compiled selectors are assigned to a special type called SEL


Views

For multiple views we introduce the need for a Root View Controller
Typically lives in the MainWindow.xib
UITabController and UINavigationController, can be used together
For example, a tab content view could be a UINavigationController and vice versa


Sound 

AudioToolbox.h
Types we care about: SystemSoundId
Have to include: #import <AudioToolbox/AudioToolbox.h>
SystemSoundId typed variable has to be just straight variable, not a pointer
